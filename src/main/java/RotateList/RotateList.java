/**
 * Finish the class RotateList make it subclasse the built-in List class. (Hint extends ?????)
 * Write a function that rotates a list by k elements.
 * For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by 2 becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2].
 * The first 2 elements where rotated to the back of the List.
 * If it was rotated by 3 [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated becomes [4,5,6,1,2,3].
 * Try solving this without creating a copy of the list.
 * How many swap or move operations do you need?
